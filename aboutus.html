    <div id="blankspace"></div>
    <p>I’m Abhay Singh, a passionate developer dedicated to making education accessible to everyone. I believe learning should be free, open, and available to anyone who seeks knowledge. With this platform, my goal is to provide quality educational resources that empower students to learn new skills and achieve their dreams without financial barriers. Technology has the power to transform lives, and I want to use it to create opportunities for all. This project is my small step toward building a brighter, more educated, and inclusive world for learners everywhere.</p>
